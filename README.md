In this assignment, you are required to prepare a comprehensive client-side interface for a
Web Application. You are free to choose any web application of your liking or the application
which you see can easily demonstrate majority of features or techniques being discussed in
this module. You can take inspiration from the list of applications presented in the lecture but
you are not limited to any of those applications. You are strongly encouraged to carefully select
your web application considering that you will be further enhancing the same assignment
introducing additional features as the semester goes by. 

## VERSION 1
- Demonstrate a complete understanding of Web Application types and their
requirements.
- Prepare and showcase important information collection and presentation for
your selected application.
- Use a broad range of HTML tags and HTML 5 features.
- Demonstrate ability to design an easy to navigate user interface and visually
appealing to a variety of audience.
- Design and implement different types of CSS files for your web application
interface.
- Demonstrate effective use of CSS for your web application using a broad range
of CSS rules.
- Demonstrate your understanding of the HTML and CSS code by adding
comments in your code wherever possible. 

## VERSION 2

n this assignment, you are required to extend the client-side interface for your Web application
submitted as Assignment 1. You are required to introduce Java Script and related technologies 
learnt during Lecture 3 and Lecture 4 to enhance client-side interface for your web application. 
You also need to demonstrate good Java Script programming/scripting skills for processing 
HTML/CSS document, dynamic content generation, event handling and local data processing.

- ntroduce a dynamic menu bar on top and/or side panel of your web application. The 
menu bar should only appear after a client-side event (click, mouse over etc.) is 
captured and should disappear on capturing another event. Please note that you are 
required to create this menu bar using JavaScript rather than CSS only and it should 
be more aesthetic in design and appearance. You are encouraged to come up with 
your innovative design ideas and introduce multiple features (fading in, scrolling, 
dynamic positioning etc.) which you believe are suitable for your web application and 
target audience. An example menu bar from Google maps is shown below. 
- Create at least two different HTML forms in your web application having minimum 10
different input fields/types combined in both forms requiring input from a user. You are 
required to introduce different types of validation checks and controls for user input 
fields using Java Script and also provide suggestions/hint to the user regarding the 
right input.
- Using the web forms, you created for Q2, collect user input dynamically and store all 
inputs from user either into a local file or in system cache. Then introduce a button in 
your webpage which on click displays all responses received so far in a tabular form 
creating dynamic html table and its contents. Alternatively, you can get dynamic input 
from the user in the form and display the input incrementally just below the form e.g. A 
table below the form which has one row added after every time a submit button is hit 
on the form. You can use either HTML local storage or AJAX external contents loading 
functionality. 
- Introduce different events capturing functionality within your web application. You are 
expected to introduce a variety of events capturing function (e.g. alert, Click, Key, 
Mouse Over, Document Load, and Document Close etc.). Please use these functions 
as appropriate depending on the type of contents available in your web application 
interface. You are encouraged to demonstrate a wide range of user events being 
captured rather than a repetition of single event capturing functionality replicated over 
different pages. 
- Using JQuery to capture DOM tree of a Webpage in your application. Add a button at 
the bottom of your Web page and once a user clicks that button it should display DOM 
Tree of your document by appending at the bottom of the same page. You are free to 
use any styles for displaying DOM Tree e.g. tree structure, and indentation in a list etc. 

## Tech

These technologies are used in projects to work properly:

- [HTML5] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [CSS3] - Awesome Designing
- [Javascript] - Client Side Scripts
- [BOOTSTRAPS] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [JQUERRY] - more easy and short js implementation
- [SQlite3] - the embedable databases
